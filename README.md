# dictees
French dictees open sourced for everyone. Level around CM2. Part of a project for my nephews :)

Thanks a lot to all the open sourcers of dictees below :
- Jean-Luc Mador√©, https://cheminsfaisant.fr
- open sourced dictees from tv5monde http://dictee.tv5monde.com/

Releasing this under the CC license. Seems fairer :)

Possible improvements :
- Creating a distance ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance ) between two strings
- Putting a very simple website allowing people to make their own "dictees"
- Checking the differences
